# Typing-Game
Creating a typing game that tracks accuracy and wpm for my website.
Currently, the site is basic and consists of text, a text box, and a timer.  The user begins the game by starting to type the string.  At that time, the timer begins.  It only considers a user as finishing the game if the text is 100% accurate, so that will be the next thing to change.  I am using WPM = (characters typed / 5) / minutes spent typing to calculate the WPM. 

To Do for JavaScript:
    1. Make the game end once the user has typed as many characters as in the provided string, so accuracy can be less than 100%.
    2. Change how accuracy is calculated so that mistakes that were erased are still counted against accuracy.
    3. Create a scoring system that values both WPM and accuracy.
    4. Create a position tracker that shows the user there location in the string (possibly add color/effect to show user when a mistake was keyed).
    5. Create new sample strings to provide users.
    6. Possible- create leaderboard using database to store best score/user initials.

To Do for HTML:
    1.  Add instructions for user.
    2.  Increase asthetic value and conform to asthetic of rest of site.
    3.  Add text to explain the innerworkings of game.
    4.  Link to this repository?
